# Annotations for ADT: data classes and discriminated unions

Annotations and helper stuff for [algebraic data types](https://pub.dev/packages/adt) that allows you to create immutable data classes and discriminated unions, that compare as value types.

- Immutable [data class](https://pub.dev/packages/adt#data-class) with `copyWith` method.
- Immutable [discriminated unions](https://pub.dev/packages/adt#union) with pattern matching.

For immutable collections, you can use [immutable_collection](https://pub.dev/packages/immutable_collection).
